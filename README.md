## Hao Sun
Hi! I graduated from UC Berkeley, currently an ML Engineer working on LLMs, workflow & Multi-Agent system at a startup in Shanghai, China. I have 9 year experience on NLP & Software Engineering.

I co-founded and worked as CTO in startups Whimly LLC. and Beijing Youli Technology Co., Ltd focus on Travel and Social Networking web / mobile applications. I also worked as Principal Software Engineer and the AI Lead in [Veeva Systems China](https://www.veeva.com/cn/) on CRM system. I was one of the main owners and the agent architecture of Museland in Zulution AI. I currently work on general agent, visual agentic workflow and personal knowledge base implementations.

I researched on privacy-preserving diffusion sampling (ICLR '25) and language model architecture (EMNLP BlackboxNLP workshop) in Stanford University.

I co-founded academic NGO [Jungus](https://www.jungus.cn/) and maintained the personality/psychological tests services with annually 15M+ testers and collaborated with top universities in China. I also created paper understanding website [Daily Papers](https://www.dailypapers.org/) and a website [Fuwari.ai](https://www.fuwari.ai/) learning language by anime-style roleplay for fun.
