## Hao Sun
Hi! I'm an ML Research Engineer currently working on LLMs & AI Agents at a startup in Shanghai, China. I have 8 year experience on NLP & Software Engineering. I'm also an SCPD student in Artificial Intelligence at Stanford University currently researching on LMs & generative AI, and an alumni of University of California, Berkeley in Computer Science.

I co-founded and worked as CTO in startups Whimly LLC. and Beijing Youli Technology Co., Ltd focus on Travel and Social Networking web / mobile applications. I also worked as Principal Software Engineer and the AI Lead in [Veeva Systems China](https://www.veeva.com/cn/) on CRM system.

I researched and implemented an easy to hack [Backpack Language Models repository](https://github.com/SwordElucidator/nanoBackpackLM) in Stanford University mentored by [John Hewitt](https://nlp.stanford.edu/~johnhew/), and achieved best custom project on CS224N (2023). The refined work was accepted by BlackboxNLP 2023.

I co-founded academic NGO [Jungus](https://www.jungus.cn/) and maintained the personality/psychological tests services with annually 5M+ testers and collaborated with top universities in China.
